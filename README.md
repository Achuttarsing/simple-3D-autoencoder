This repo is designed to run with Google Colaboratory â†’ in fact, the EMD and Chamfer losses are pre-compiled for the Colab environment

### What can I do ?

With this repo, you can easily train an autoencoder on your own dataset. You just have to click on the *"Open In Colab"* button. 

By default, a chair dataset can be downloaded with the ```download_data.sh```
